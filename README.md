- ## Day 16 – SQL Practice & Reinforcement

### Focus:
Rewriting previous SQL tasks independently to improve speed and syntax confidence.

### Queries Practiced:

- Filtered engineers in 2023 and sorted by salary (TOP 5)
- Found lowest Data Scientist salary in 2023
- Retrieved top fully remote salaries (remote_ratio = 100)
- Counted distinct job titles
- Calculated MIN, MAX, AVG salary for 2023
- Converted salary from USD to UAH using multiplication
- Used ROUND() for formatting
- Applied ORDER BY using column position (ORDER BY 1)

### Key Concepts Reinforced:
- SELECT / WHERE / ORDER BY / LIMIT
- LIKE operator
- DISTINCT
- Aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT)
- Salary conversion using arithmetic operations
- Column aliasing (AS)
- Understanding ORDER BY by column index

### Improvements Noticed:
- Queries written significantly faster than previous day
- Better understanding of SQL structure
- Less hesitation with syntax

## Day 17 – SQL Logical Practice

### Focus:
Practiced complex filtering and subqueries.

### Topics:
- AND / OR precedence and parentheses
- IN vs OR
- BETWEEN vs IN
- HAVING vs WHERE
- Nested subqueries
- GROUP BY + aggregation
- LIMIT / OFFSET (2nd highest value)
- Word count logic using string functions

### Key Insight:
Better understanding of SQL execution order and logical grouping.
Queries written faster than previous days.

### Reflection:
Still polishing syntax, but logic and confidence improving.

Day 18 – SQL JOIN + HAVING Deep Practice

Focus:
Practiced multi-table JOINs, aggregation, and filtering aggregated results using subqueries.

Topics:
INNER JOIN (3–4 table chains)
LEFT JOIN logic and anti-join pattern
Revenue calculation with SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity)
Granularity awareness (Invoice vs InvoiceLine level)
Avoiding double counting
COUNT vs SUM differences
HAVING with subquery
Nested subqueries in WHERE and HAVING
Derived tables (subquery in FROM)
Primary key awareness (when DISTINCT is unnecessary)

Key Insight:
Strong improvement in understanding aggregation levels and execution order.
Clearer distinction between row-level data and aggregated-level data.
Better control over JOIN logic and grouping strategy.

Reflection:
JOIN feels much more natural.
Nested subqueries are challenging but becoming clearer.
Main difficulty now is structural thinking, not logic itself.
